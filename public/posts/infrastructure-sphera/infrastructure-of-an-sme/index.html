With this in mind, a customer approached me and asked me to digitize their operations. This article dives into the process of developing a whole new IT suite for a European parcel shipping company that is based in Greece.\nCustomer Background This enterprise has been operating for 4 years in the parcel logistics industry, their main focus is handling parcel logistics to Europe and Western Asia (mainly ex-Soviet nations) that is targeted to individuals rather than enterprises, although they serve this niche too.\nThe company is a subsidiary of Sphera Group and brands itself as Sphera Express.\nIt serves Europe, Russia and Western Asia via truck, or ship depending on the destination region.\nSince their start, they’ve used no-code solutions such as Notion and Airtable (and even Excel occassionally) to store customer and parcel data, which in my opinion is very outstanding for a business in such a niche, but this became unreliable once they reached a huge amount of data \u0026 realized they are in need of custom automations: from customer communication \u0026 parcel tracking, to tax automation and bookkeeping.\nAfter a quick analysis, the three main bottlenecks were:\nWorkers were losing a lot of time for tasks that concern messaging with clients, those could be automated. (even with no-code or low-code) Keeping track of \u003e1 tonne of cargo every week that are distributed globally, unquestionably laborious given the generic solutions they used. Salesperson that accepts the parcel was editing a Photoshop template to label the parcel, and pasted a QR-code, dull \u0026 time inneficient. Online Representation Their digital presence mainly consists of their website and their social media, the prior was developed by me, when they launched earlier.\nIt already had everything they need along with integrations for their partners, so I moved on.\nReinventing the wheel When I tell my colleagues that I developed a software to store customers and their related shipments in the warehouses, of course they tell me “could’ve used a CRM or something like that”, but this was not the case. It simply did not suit them, and it was very end-customer-oriented, which disrupts the focus from the parcels - therefore losing it’s main point.\nDon’t get me wrong, customers are valued as much as the parcel itself, but without the parcel there would be no customer.\nGetting closer to the point, the software that they are now using for operations was hard to develop mainly because of the exotic nature of their operations, each region (sometimes not a nation, but a city or a state) had it’s own pricing formula, and statistically speaking, a new region is being served every fiscal quarter, but is there any point when I have to add the new formula to the DB? No, so after trying a lot of ways to avoid this, I found a way for the company staff to manage this.\nI introduced a mini “scripting language” to them, that I had implemented just for this project. Basically, for each region that they operate, they describe the pricing via linear \u0026 non-linear progression (depends on the region, again) and store that into a DB.\nOf course, this introduces a potential injection attack, but I took my measures and prevented it via validation.\nThis whole formula thing is much simpler than it sounds, one just has to analyze the pattern.\nTechnical Details Upon customer’s approval, I decided to go serverless: instead of using traditional Django, FastAPI or Flask-backed apps, I went on with the recently-renovated Next.JS that was then hosted on Vercel \u0026 Supabase for authentication, Postgres \u0026 storage, hence minimizing their IT costs, even better.\nConsidering Next.JS supports serverless/lambda functions and Supabase offers GraphQL, I managed to develop quite a performant \u0026 secure solution.\nOf course, this combination might not be the perfect solution for everyone, but in my case, it was really the most optimal way I could’ve thought of, without large costs on development and maintainment in the long-term.\nOne could have gone his own way, self-hosting SQL or using Mongo, writing a backend in FastAPI or Express, using Angular for the frontend, like most companies in this industry have been doing.\nI ignored the industry standards \u0026 approached it differently, put some respect on the IT guy, let him have a beer on a Friday night instead of fixing MySQL shards.\n","wordCount":"740","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-02-21T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Edward
